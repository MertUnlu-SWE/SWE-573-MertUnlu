# Project Name: Study Git As a Version Management System and Wikidata Research Project

## Project Description
This repository is created as part of SWE 573 course. The main purpose is to learn about **Git** as a version control system and experiment with the **Wikidata API**. I will explore the basics of Git commands, set up a repository, and document my findings on the Wiki page.

## Goals
- Understand how Git works and learn basic commands.
- Customize the GitHub repository by creating issues, assigning labels, and maintaining a clean history.
- Explore the Wikidata API, perform queries, and document the results.
- Use the knowledge gained to create a simple research page on the project Wiki.
